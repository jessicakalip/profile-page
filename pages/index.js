          <p>
            I‚Äôm Jessica Kalip, a 27 year old Full-Stack Developer with 2 years
            of programming experience. I started my programming career with the
            <b> Le Wagon full-stack web development bootcamp</b>¬†in Bali and
            have continued on to work full-time (Jan 2022 - Jul 2023), and then
            freelance (August 2023 onwards) for{" "}

            I am currently open to freelance remote positions as a
            <b> Full-Stack Web Developer</b> and am looking to create impactful
            products in a company with a remote-first culture, supportive
            teammates, and a fun learning environment!

          <p>
            Over the past 2 years, I‚Äôve learnt and grown so much as a developer
            with Collato, working on features in their main app, tackling pesky
            bugs, as well as being responsible for maintaining and rebranding
            their{" "}

          <p>
            Examples of some of the tasks I undertook during my time with
            Collato were writing tests in Jest and Cypress, setting up the
            Storybook Component Library, setting up Gatsby Preview to aid the
            growth team in visualising changes before it goes live, making the
            app mobile-responsive, as well as creating the Podcast page on our
            Landing Page.
